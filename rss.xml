Hope is a gift you don't have to surrender, a power you don't have to throw away. And though hope can be an act of defiance, defiance isn't enough reason to hope.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1a0648d0d33963c3ee8e41185e4a3aff/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi.guim.co.uk%2Fimg%2Fmedia%2F0e18e5aed8f08609657bab7df553b352ee2f99ba%2F0_93_3872_2323%2F3872.jpg%3Fw%3D1200%26h%3D630%26q%3D55%26auto%3Dformat%26usm%3D12%26fit%3Dcrop%26bm%3Dnormal%26ba%3Dbottom%252Cleft%26blend64%3DaHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n%26s%3Dc6d46ecd046a5d38d54a43d0b872447d"></article>]]></description>
