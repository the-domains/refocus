  Lauren's company, The Simply Co., sells cleaning products that are sustainable
  and toxin-free. And while Lauren's glad people are choosing to purchase
  products that don't hurt the earth, she would rather we all make them on our
  own. Because sustainability is more than a job to Lauren. It's her life.
