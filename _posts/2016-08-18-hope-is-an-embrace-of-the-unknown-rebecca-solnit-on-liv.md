  Your opponents would love you to believe that it's hopeless, that you have no
  power, that there's no reason to act, that you can't win. Hope is a gift you
  don't have to surrender, a power you don't have to throw away. And though hope
  can be an act of defiance, defiance isn't enough reason to hope.
